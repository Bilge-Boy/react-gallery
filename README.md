#React Gallery

In this exercise, you will use state with an API to make a gallery.
It should look [like this](https://giuthub.com/evyros/react-gallery/tree/master/public/result.mp4)

### Instructions:
1. Fork this repo to your account
2. Clone it
3. `cd react-gallery`
4. `npm install`
5. `npm start`

### API
You will need to use 2 API endpoints:
1. To get the albums:
`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums`
2. To get the photos of an album:
`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos?albumId=[ID]`
where [ID] is the album's ID of course.

### Hints:
You don't need to create any new components, you can use App component only.
